# tictactoe
A quick tic tac toe program I wrote to practice my programming skillz in quarantine

This is a console based tictactoe game

The game alternates between player X and player O

The player is prompted to input an integer in the range 1-9 inclusive.
The board is indexed as such:
#####

#123#

#456#

#789#

#####

Once a 3-in-a-row is detected, the game will declare the winner and clear the board, beginning another game.
